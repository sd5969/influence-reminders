# influence-reminders

This tool sends anyone who signs up an email every Monday morning with a reminder
of one of the influence prescriptions taught in Wharton's OIDD 693 course.

## Installation

Clone this repository, add the cron sample (adjusted to your file location) to
your crontab and ensure your `mail` command works. You can also host the `index.php`
to get the web interface working.
